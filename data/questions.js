You can physically give 3 apples to the first child and the other 3 apples to the second child. This shows that each child gets 3 apples:Each child gets 3 apples.  <br> <strong>Method</strong>:Step 1: Look at the total number of apples,In this case, you have 6 apples.<br>Step 2: Look at how many children you're sharing the apples with,There are 2 children.<br>Step 3: To divide evenly, cut the total number of apples in half (since you are splitting between 2 children),6 ÷ 2 = 3 apples per child. <br><strong>Explanation:</strong> When dividing something equally, think of it like sharing a set of items into equal parts.
